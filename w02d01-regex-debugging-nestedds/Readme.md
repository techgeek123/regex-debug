- Understand and iterate over data in multidimensial arrays

## Overview

#### Overview of Regex
A regular expression (regex or regexp for short) is a special text string for describing a search pattern. You can think of regular expressions as wildcards on steroids. You are probably familiar with wildcard notations such as `*.txt` to find all text files in a file manager. The regex equivalent is `^.*\.txt$.`This,being just an example.Much more can be done using Regular Expressions. 
- Explore what regex is. Read through the exploration links
- Think of when would you use a RegEx. How do we verify if an e-mail is an e-mail? Or the same for a phone number or a ZIP code. What about Aadhar? 
- Once you are satisfied with your knowledge, move on to the Core Blocks.

#### Overview of Debugging

Debugging is the routine process of locating and removing computer program bugs, errors or abnormalities, which is methodically handled by software programmers via debugging tools. Debugging checks, detects and corrects errors or bugs to allow proper program operation according to set specifications.
- When in doubt, print it out
- Why do you think we need debugging
- What are some of the basic errors that you can think of
- Move on to the Core Blocks once you've researched on these


#### Overview of Nested DS 
A data structure,in some sense,is just that: a way of structuring data. In computer science, there are a multitude of different data structures, because the most efficient way to store data depends on how you intend to use the data. Do you just need to read the data, or do you need to update it? How large is your set of data, and how quickly do you need to find things in it? Questions like these greatly influence what type of data structure you should be using.

For now, though, we'll keep things limited to Objects and Arrays. We've already seen how to use both of these structures to organize data. As we'll see in this unit, even with just these two data structures, we can get pretty far in terms of storing and accessing complex data.

- What, then, is a nested data structure? Why would you use something like this? 
- Is a matrix a nested DataStructure?
- Can you have nested-nested-data structures. What does this mean? Can you think of some examples where you might need to use these?
- As always, move on to the Core Blocks once you've researched on these
