## Core Blocks

In this challenge, you will be learning about Regular Expressions


## Release 0:

Start with [this](https://regexcrossword.com/) interactive puzzle to help you learn all RegEx operators really quickly


## Release 1:

`countEvenNumbers`

Write a function called countEvenNumbers which accepts a string of numbers and returns the count of numbers between 0 and 9.
```js
countEvenNumbers("321321dsadsa930-29d132b13a") // 16
countEvenNumbers("this is so wonderful") // 0
countEvenNumbers("this is so 1234") // 4
```

## Release 2:

`capitalSentence`

Write a function called capitalSentence which accepts a string and returns another string with all the capital letters joined together.
```js
capitalSentence("The Cat In The Hat") // "TCITH"
capitalSentence("And I Think to Myself What a Wonderful World") // "AITMWWW"
```

## Release 3:
Answer the following questions:

- What are the two ways to create regular expression in JavaScript?
- What is a flag?
- What is the difference between `?`, `+`, `*`?
- What is the difference between `[]` and `{}`?

## Release 4:

In all of the below, the question is, does the regular expression match the full string.  This can be fully specified by preceding the regular expression with ^ (beginning-of-string character) and and following it with $ (end-of-string character); to aid legibility, we have nto included these characters.  Slash (/) is the delimiter character showing where the regular expression begins and ends.   Strings to be matched start and end with non-blank characters: there are no leading or trailing blanks.
